    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access 
        to the webpage from which it was opened.
        
        The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing 
        which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
        The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour 
        and thus can be used by itself as well.
